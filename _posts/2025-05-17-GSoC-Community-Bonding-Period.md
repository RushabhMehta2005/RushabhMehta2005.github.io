## Introduction and Getting into GSoC

Hi! I’m **Rushabh Mehta**, a second-year Computer Engineering student at **VJTI, Mumbai**. I’m very excited to share that I’ll be working with **SymPy** as part of **Google Summer of Code 2025**.

When I received the acceptance email, I was stunned. It took a few moments for it to sink in. Months of my effort of researching, debugging, writing code, talking with the kind SymPy reviewers and getting my PRs merged, and working on my proposal had finally paid off. My project, **“Implementing Wrapping Geometries for Musculoskeletal Modeling”**, focuses on extending SymPy’s biomechanics module, and I can’t wait to dive into the work.

I’ll be collaborating with incredible people, my mentors **Jason Moore**, **Hwayeon Kang** and the rest of SymPy maintainers. I will post weekly updates here throughout the summer. This blog will also be a space for anything else I find interesting—technical thoughts, reflections, or random curiosities.

## Community Bonding

The community bonding period has been a great start. I’ve had the chance to interact with other contributors, introduce myself, and connect with people working on fascinating projects. It’s motivating to be surrounded by such energy and curiosity. I feel like a part of a bigger team.

I also switched to **Ubuntu** as my main operating system for ease of development. I set up my development environment for SymPy and now I feel very confident to start talking to my mentors and getting acquainted with the codebase.

So far, everything has been smooth and encouraging. I’m feeling confident and excited as the coding period begins!
