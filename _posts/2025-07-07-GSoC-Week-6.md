### Highlights

* Polished two open pull requests and added new unit tests.
* Updated `point_on_surface` to return a symbolic expression instead of a boolean, per Jason Moore’s suggestion.
* Refactored the WrappingSphere example: improved explanations, reorganized code, and added a hands-on use-case.

### Pull Request: `point_on_surface` Enhancement

* **Symbolic Output**: Changed the method signature to return a Sympy equation (`Eq(x, y)`) so users can manipulate the constraint directly.
* **Docstrings & Examples**: Expanded the docstring to include parameter definitions, return types, and two inline usage snippets.
* **Edge-Case Tests**: Added tests for degenerate cases (zero-radius sphere, point exactly on the north pole, and random off-surface points) to ensure robustness.
* **Pending Review**: Tagged Jason Moore for final feedback on the symbolic interface.

### WrappingSphere Example Overhaul

* **Step-by-Step Narrative**: Broke the example into three sections—Setup, Theory (radial approximation), and Visualization.
* **Interpretation Guide**: Walks the reader through reading the symbolic output from `point_on_surface`, substituting numeric values, and verifying solutions graphically.

### Next Steps

1. Incorporate Jason’s feedback on first PR and merge once approved.
2. Address any final CI or style issues flagged by the maintainers.

Here’s to wrapping up these changes and moving forward!
