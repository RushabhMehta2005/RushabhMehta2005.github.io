After a brief slowdown due to the start of college and on-campus internship drives (in which I secured an internship with DE Shaw & Co for Summer of 2026!), progress on SymPy’s `WrappingCone` is back on track.

## WrappingCone Status

The core of the `WrappingCone` class is complete except for the `geodesic_end_vectors` method. All other methods, have been implemented and tested. Symbolic testing for `geodesic_end_vectors` remains to be added once the method is in place.

## Example Models

With guidance from my mentor, I explored two example models to illustrate and test `WrappingCone`:

1. Cable car wrapping over a cone: derived contact lengths and draped segments, and shared the full derivation in LaTeX.
2. Conical pendulum

These examples will serve as regression tests and user tutorials.

## Next Steps

* Code review feedback: address stylistic comments and improve docstrings.
* Complete `geodesic_end_vectors` and add symbolic tests for edge cases.
* Finalize tutorials and integrate them into the SymPy documentation.

Despite the early slowdown, Weeks 8–10 have laid the groundwork for a fully tested, documented, and merged `WrappingCone`.
