### Discussions and Change of Plans

After a brief discussion with Jason Moore on my [PR #28098](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/28098) and talking
with my mentor, we decided to first focus on **verifying and testing the wrapping geometry objects** first.
We concluded that the best way to do so was not by writing more extensive and exhaustive tests, but by
building a real model. This would not only verify the correctness of the code but also serve as a tutorial for the users.

### My Work

We had to test the 2 pre-existing wrapping geometries, namely the ``WrappingSphere`` and the ``WrappingCylinder``.
I decided to start working on the **[Atwood's machine](https://www.aplusphysics.com/courses/honors/dynamics/Atwood.html) model for the WrappingCylinder example**.
First I simply implemented the model to test whether wrapping geometry objects are useful or do they need some improvement.
I found out that whenever you have a wrapping path between two points P1 and P2, if you want to find the wrapping length
or the forces along that line, you must first manually find their tangent points T1 and T2, on the surface of the geometry.

This manual-tangent-point finding work is handled by no other object/class in sympy and the users must do it themselves,
atleast for now. After getting my first real code review, I made changes to my code and then proceeded to write a full 
example in .rst format along with Sphinx for the docs.

In parallel, I also got started with working on **integrating the ``WrappingSphere`` object into the biomechanical example**.
This was hard at first due to having no background in biomechanics, but I pieced it together. I only have ran into a minor issue with lambdify, but other than that the output graphs were correct.

I also made a PR to [planet sympy](https://planet.sympy.org/) in order to have my blog there as well!

PRs Created:
 - [PR #28098](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/28098)
 - [PR #28111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/28111)
 - [Planet SymPy PR](https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy/pull/124)


### My Thoughts

Overall I feel good about the progress this week and am excited to get the WrappingCylinder PR merged and
to create one for the WrappingSphere example.
See y'all next week!
