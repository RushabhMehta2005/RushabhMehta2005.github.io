## Final Weeks
I’ve been juggling college work and the final stretch of the project, so things have been busy. My mentor and I agreed that the elastic-pendulum-cone example will be the final PR for the GSoC coding period. Everything is basically done only a small change to the example is holding the PR up at the moment, and I will finish that.

## What’s next

I’ll wrap up that small example change to unblock the PR, then follow up on any remaining review requests. After the GSoC period I plan to keep an eye on follow-up issues, fix bugs that come up.

This has been a fantastic learning experience - both technically and in how to work within a large open source project. Huge thanks to my mentors, Hwayeon Kang and Jason Moore, for their guidance and reviews. I had excellent, timely help from my mentors, which made it easy to decide design direction and to get constructive feedback on PRs. Their reviews helped me write safer, clearer code. I’d also like to thank the SymPy community and maintainers for their patience and for helping me get my changes into shape.
