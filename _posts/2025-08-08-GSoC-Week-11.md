## WrappingCone Status

Me and my mentor Hwayeon, had a longer sync-up meeting this week to discuss everything in more detail. She told me to add the complete worked out math of the cable car model and send it publicly on github so that she could view it. I finally learnt some latex in order to get the math to render nicely and not have to rely on any external sources. I worked out all of the math of the model and sent it. I also added a lot of explanatory comments on the `geodesic_end_vectors` method so that it gets easier to review it. 
In my opinion as the contributor, this PR is fully ready for review, just awaiting on my mentor now. 

## Example Model

Currently I am exploring the conical pendulum model so that we can add yet another example to the docs. I will open a seperate PR for it and start writing the docs once the model specifics and the math have been finalized after discussion with my mentor. 

## Next Steps

1. Respond to final review comments if any on current PR.
2. Open new PR for tutorial example model.
